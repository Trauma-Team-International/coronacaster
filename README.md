Coronacast is a probabilistic programming method for time-series forecasting of COVID-19 cases based on empirical data. 
</p>

### What?

ICUSIM dramatically simplifies the process ICU demand, capacity, and fatality simulation. The simulation is based on a logic that closely resembles the current empirical understanding of the problem. The power of Monte Carlo simulation can be summarized in two points: 

- Input parameter ranges are based on empirical evidence
- There is no ambiquity in terms of results

**Fig 1:** An example of simulation result where we test how often peak daily demand for standard ICU capacity stays below 278 (the official forecast of THL in Finland).

This allows the consumer of the information to establish their own point-of-view regarding how likely a certain outcome may be. The Monte Carlo method entirely takes away doubt from the question "given a range of parameters, how often so and so values appear".

### Why?

- Make forecasts to increase preparadness
- Test plausibility of forecasts made with other methods

<hr>

### How?

ICUSIM follows a straightforward logic:

- There is a certain number of patients to start with
- Patients are split between standard and ventilated ICU
- Patients can not move between standard and ventilated ICU
- New patients come in based on `doubles_in_days` input parameter
- As new patients come in, each is assigned with a probability to survive
- As new patients come in, each is assigned a stay duration
- Released or dead, it happens when stay duration is completed
- If there is less capacity than there is demand, patients will die accordingly

Outcomes are controlled through **Input Parameters**, which are provided separately for _standard ICU_ and _ventilated ICU_.

### ðŸ’¾ Install

Released version:

#### `pip install coronacaster`

Daily development version:

#### `pip install git+https://github.com/autonomio/coronacaster`

<hr>

### Start Forecasting

To run a simulation, you need two things:

- time-series data
- `coronacaster.forecast()` command

```
import coronacaster

data = coronacaster.get_data_from_eu()
coronacaster.forecast('Finland', data, startdate='2020-04-01')
```

As a reference, plot the country's data: 

```
coronacaster.plot_country('Finland', data)
```
