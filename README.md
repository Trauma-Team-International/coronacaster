Coronacast is a probabilistic programming method for time-series forecasting of COVID-19 cases based on empirical data. 
</p>

<hr>

### What?

ICUSIM dramatically simplifies the process ICU demand, capacity, and fatality simulation. The simulation is based on a logic that closely resembles the current empirical understanding of the problem. The power of Monte Carlo simulation can be summarized in two points: 

- Input parameter ranges are based on empirical evidence
- There is no ambiquity in terms of results

**Fig 1:** An example of simulation result where we test how often peak daily demand for standard ICU capacity stays below 278 (the official forecast of THL in Finland).

This allows the consumer of the information to establish their own point-of-view regarding how likely a certain outcome may be. The Monte Carlo method entirely takes away doubt from the question "given a range of parameters, how often so and so values appear".

### Why?

There are very few reasonable forecasting methods for COVID-19 cases that are 100% based on what has actually happened and where validation is built-in. 

<hr>

### How?

coronacaster follows a straightforward logic:

- Data consist of cases and deaths for all countries from 1st of January, 2020
- An option between exponential and polynomial functions is provided
- Many countries yield meaningful results

The `coronacaster.forecast()` command accepts the following parameters:

name | type | description
--- | --- | --- 
`country` | str | Country name, if there is "countries" column in the data - else use "World or "" for all data
`data` | DataFrame | dataframe with "dates" (datetime) and "cases" columns - coses is the number of daily new cases
`ftype` | str | 'polyN' where N is a number between 0 and a few (don't try more than 10 or so - becomes quite slow) or  'exp'  for exponential
`samples` | int | number of samples to use
`startdate` | str | start date number
`enddate` | str | end date number
`limit` | int | take start date to be where cumulative count exceeds limit
`**kwargs` | float | model params if wanted to use (see models.py)

### ðŸ’¾ Install

Released version:

#### `pip install coronacaster`

Daily development version:

#### `pip install git+https://github.com/autonomio/coronacaster`

<hr>

### Start Forecasting

To run a simulation, you need two things:

- time-series data
- `coronacaster.forecast()` command

```
import coronacaster

data = coronacaster.get_data_from_eu()
coronacaster.forecast('Finland', data, startdate='2020-04-01')
```

As a reference, plot the country's data: 

```
coronacaster.plot_country('Finland', data)
```
